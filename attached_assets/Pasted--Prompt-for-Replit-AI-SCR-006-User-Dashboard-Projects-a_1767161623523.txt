# 📘 Prompt for Replit AI – SCR-006: User Dashboard, Projects, and Task Views

## 🎯 Objective:
Develop the **User-side dashboard** that allows logged-in standard users to:
- View assigned projects
- Access and interact with tasks
- Update task status
- See performance insights (optional)
- Navigate via user-specific options (user avatar, logout, settings)

## 🧱 Components Required:

### 1. Layout
- Use the same app shell layout:
  - **Left Panel**: Navigation
    - Dashboard
    - My Projects
    - My Tasks
    - Settings
    - Logout
  - **Right Panel**: Main dynamic content

---

### 2. User Dashboard Page (`/user/dashboard`)
- **Widgets**:
  - Assigned Projects (as cards with name, status)
  - Total Tasks, Completed Tasks, Pending Tasks
  - Progress Chart (Pie/Bar chart using Chart.js or Recharts)
- **Animations**:
  - Smooth fade-in for cards
  - Slide-up for statistics
- **Data Source**:
  - Fetch assigned projects and tasks from `/api/projects?userId={id}` and `/api/tasks?userId={id}`

---

### 3. My Projects Page (`/user/projects`)
- **Grid View** of all assigned projects.
- Each card clickable to navigate to Kanban board like:
  `/user/projects/:projectId`
- Card Includes:
  - Project Name
  - Status
  - Progress Bar (Based on task completion)
  - Created Date
- **Filters**: By status (Active, Completed)

---

### 4. My Tasks Page (`/user/tasks`)
- Tabular view of all tasks assigned to this user.
- Columns:
  - Title
  - Bucket
  - Priority
  - Due Date
  - Status (Can be updated by user)
  - Estimated Time (Hours & Minutes)
  - Start Date, End Date
- **Status Dropdown**: Allow user to change from Todo ⟷ In Progress ⟷ Completed
- **Editable Fields**: Only editable if not yet marked completed

---

### 5. User Top Bar (Global Component)
- Top-right avatar with:
  - Profile Settings
  - Change Password
  - Logout

---

### 6. Navigation Behavior
- Ensure role-based routing: if `role=standard_user`, they only see `/user/*` routes.
- Prevent access to `/admin/*` routes.

---

## 💡 Backend Updates:
- Ensure APIs support user-specific queries:
  - `/api/projects?userId=`
  - `/api/tasks?userId=`
- Update task schema to include:
  - `startDate`, `endDate`
  - `estimatedTimeHours`, `estimatedTimeMinutes`

---

## 🌐 Design Notes:
- Light theme
- Use modern design system (dev21)
- All cards should have hover elevation, smooth load animations, and shadow borders
- Ensure mobile responsiveness

---

## ✅ Expected Result:
A fully functional **User Dashboard**, **Project Grid**, and **Task Table**, with interactive status updates and analytics.
