# Prompt: Update Projects Page with Edit, Clone, and Delete (SCR-007)
# Context: SPECTROPY PMS – User/Admin Projects Page
# Path: @client/src/pages/Projects.tsx
# Goal: Add full project management actions for each project card
# Tech Stack: React + Tailwind + Shadcn + Framer Motion + Dev21 Light Theme

## 🧱 Requirements:

1. **Project Card Buttons**
- Each project card must have three actions:
  1. **Edit**
     - Opens a modal/dialog
     - Allows editing the **Project Name**
     - Updates project via `/api/projects/:id` (PATCH)
     - Should show success/failure message
  2. **Clone**
     - Opens a modal/dialog
     - Ask for new project name
     - Clone all project data (including buckets & tasks) into a new project
     - Call API `/api/projects/clone/:id` (POST)
     - Update UI to show the new project in grid view
  3. **Delete**
     - Opens a confirmation dialog
     - Permanently deletes the project and all its associated tasks
     - Must be **isolated**: project & tasks should **not appear in history or logs anywhere**
     - Call API `/api/projects/:id` (DELETE)
     - Update UI to remove the project card

## 🧠 Functional Instructions:

- Fetch all projects as usual using `/api/projects`
- Map over projects and render buttons on each card:
  - Edit: opens inline modal
  - Clone: opens modal for name input, duplicates project
  - Delete: confirmation dialog → delete project & related tasks
- Ensure **state updates** after each action (invalidate react-query cache or refresh data)
- Handle errors and show toast notifications

## 💻 Backend Instructions:

- Edit project API: `PATCH /api/projects/:id` → update name
- Clone project API: `POST /api/projects/clone/:id` → duplicate project structure and tasks
- Delete project API: `DELETE /api/projects/:id` → remove project and all related tasks
- Ensure deleted project/tasks do **not appear in history/logs**
- Optional: flag `isDeleted` or hard delete based on future audit log plan

## 🎨 Design:

- Use **Dev21 buttons** with icons (Edit: Pencil, Clone: Copy, Delete: Trash)
- Confirm dialogs should be visually distinct
- Hover & click animations for each action button
- Responsive grid layout for projects
- Show updated project list immediately after actions

---

## 📁 File Structure:

- `/src/pages/Projects.tsx` → updated project cards with buttons
- `/src/components/projects/EditProjectDialog.tsx`
- `/src/components/projects/CloneProjectDialog.tsx`
- `/src/components/projects/DeleteProjectDialog.tsx`

---

## ✅ Expected Result:

- Project cards now have **Edit, Clone, Delete** actions
- Edit updates the name inline
- Clone duplicates the project with new name
- Delete permanently removes project and tasks from UI and prevents appearance in logs/history
- Smooth UI animations and Dev21 styling
