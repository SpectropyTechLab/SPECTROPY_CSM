You are working on the Spectropy PMS – a fullstack project management system inspired by Microsoft Planner. We are modifying the Project Board (Kanban) screen where users manage tasks within buckets. The tech stack is React + Vite + Tailwind, Node.js + Express, and PostgreSQL.

**Objective:**
Update the existing Task model and UI to include support for the following new fields:
1. `startDate` – Date when task is scheduled to begin.
2. `endDate` – Deadline or due date for the task.
3. `estimateHours` and `estimateMinutes` – Time estimation fields to plan effort on a task.

---

### 🔧 Backend Changes (Express + PostgreSQL):
- Modify the PostgreSQL schema (`tasks` table):
  - Add `startDate` as `DATE`
  - Add `endDate` as `DATE`
  - Add `estimateHours` as `INTEGER`
  - Add `estimateMinutes` as `INTEGER`

- Update the Task model in the backend (`@shared/schema` or wherever the type is defined) to reflect these new fields.

- Ensure `POST /api/tasks` and `PATCH /api/tasks/:id` endpoints accept these new fields, validate them, and store in DB.

### 🎨 Frontend Changes (React):
- In `ProjectBoard.tsx`, update:
  - The **"Add New Task" Dialog** to include:
    - A **Start Date Picker**
    - An **End Date Picker**
    - Two separate input fields for **Estimate (Hours, Minutes)**

  - The **Edit Task Dialog** to support:
    - Editing `startDate`, `endDate`, `estimateHours`, `estimateMinutes`
    - Persist changes to backend on Save

- Modify the task card display in the Kanban board:
  - Show time estimate (`estimateHours` h `estimateMinutes` m)
  - Show start and end dates with calendar icon

---

### ⚠️ Special Notes:
- Ensure backward compatibility for existing tasks that don’t have these new fields.
- Use accessible components (`<Input type="date">`) or a date-picker if already available in the UI system.
- Apply consistent styling to match the dev21 design system (dark theme currently).
