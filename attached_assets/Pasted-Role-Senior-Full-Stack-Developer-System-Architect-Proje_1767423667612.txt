Role: Senior Full Stack Developer & System Architect  
Project: SPECTROPY PMS  
Module: Reports Page (Refinement Update)  

---

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE

Update the **existing Reports page** to follow a **4-tab structured reporting system** with:

- Default tab = **Projects**
- Selector-driven reports in every tab
- Dynamic report updates based on selection
- Proper admin vs user access control

---

## 🧱 PAGE STRUCTURE (MANDATORY)

Route:
```
/reports
```

Layout:
- Left Panel → Global Navigation (existing)
- Right Panel → Reports Content
- Top Section → Tabs in this order:
  1. **Projects** (DEFAULT SELECTED)
  2. Users
  3. Deadlines
  4. Buckets

---

## 🔁 COMMON BEHAVIOR FOR ALL TABS

Each tab must have:

1. **Selector Panel at Top**
   - Dropdown / Date Picker depending on tab
2. **Report Area**
   - Charts, metrics, tables
3. **Dynamic Update**
   - Changing selector instantly updates reports

No tab should show data without a valid selection.

## 📁 TAB 1: PROJECTS (DEFAULT)

### Selector:
- Dropdown → List of projects
- Default → First active project

### Reports to Show:
- Project completion %
- Total tasks, completed, pending
- Overdue tasks
- Estimated vs actual time
- Bucket-wise task distribution for selected project

---

## 👤 TAB 2: USERS

### Selector:
- Dropdown → List of users
- Default:
  - Admin → No default (select required)
  - User → Logged-in user auto-selected

### Reports to Show:
- Tasks assigned to selected user
- Completed vs pending
- On-time vs delayed
- Estimated vs actual time
- Efficiency summary

---

## ⏰ TAB 3: DEADLINES

### Selector:
- Date range picker (Start date – End date)

### Reports to Show:
- Tasks with deadlines in range
- Overdue tasks
- On-time completion rate
- Average delay duration
- Deadline trend summary

---

## 🧱 TAB 4: BUCKETS

### Selector:
- Dropdown → Bucket list (To Do / In Progress / Completed)
- Optional project filter

### Reports to Show:
- Tasks currently in bucket
- Average time spent in bucket
- Tasks stuck beyond threshold
- Auto-progress vs manual movement

---

## 🔐 ACCESS CONTROL RULES

- Admin:
  - Can view all tabs and all selector options
- User:
  - Projects → Only assigned projects
  - Users → Only self
  - Deadlines → Only own tasks
  - Buckets → Only assigned project buckets

Backend must enforce this (frontend is UX only).

---

## 🎨 UX & DESIGN

- Dev21 design system
- Light mode
- Smooth tab transitions
- Animated charts (Recharts / Framer Motion)
- Clear empty states when no data exists

---

## 📂 FILE STRUCTURE (UPDATE / CREATE)

```
/src/pages/Reports.tsx
/src/components/reports/ProjectReports.tsx
/src/components/reports/UserReports.tsx
/src/components/reports/DeadlineReports.tsx
/src/components/reports/BucketReports.tsx
```

---

## ✅ EXPECTED RESULT

- Projects tab loads by default
- Each tab shows selector + reports
- Reports update dynamically on selection
- Clean, professional analytics dashboard
- Fully aligned with Spectropy PMS workflow

---

Proceed carefully and confirm once the updated Reports page is stable.
