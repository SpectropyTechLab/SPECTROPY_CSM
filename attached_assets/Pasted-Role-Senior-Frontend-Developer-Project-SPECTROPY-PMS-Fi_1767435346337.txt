Role: Senior Frontend Developer  
Project: SPECTROPY PMS  
File to Update: @client/src/pages/UserManagement.tsx  
Task: UI Refactor – Single Container + User Selector  

---

## 🎯 OBJECTIVE

Refactor the **User Management UI** so that:
- There is **ONE default container**
- Admin selects a user from a **dropdown**
- User details & permissions load **inside the same container**
- Remove multiple repeated user cards/containers

⚠️ This is a **UI change only**. Existing logic and APIs must remain intact.

---

## 🧱 CURRENT PROBLEM

- Each user is rendered in a separate container/card
- UI becomes cluttered as users increase
- Hard to manage permissions efficiently

---

## ✅ NEW UI STRUCTURE (REQUIRED)

### 1️⃣ Default Container (Single)
- Create **one main panel** titled:  
  **“User Management”**
- This container remains visible at all times

---

### 2️⃣ User Selector (Dropdown)
At the top of the container:
- Add a dropdown labeled **“Select User”**
- Dropdown options = list of users (name + email)
- No user selected by default (optional: auto-select first user)

When a user is selected:
- Load that user’s details dynamically inside the same container

---

### 3️⃣ User Details Section (Dynamic)
Inside the same container, below dropdown:
- User Name
- Email
- Role (Admin / User)
- Permissions checklist
- Toggle to promote/demote Admin
- Save / Update button

This section updates **based on selected user**.

---

## 🎨 UI & UX REQUIREMENTS

- Use Dev21 design system
- Light mode
- Clean spacing and alignment
- Smooth transition when user changes (fade / slide)
- Disable details section until a user is selected
- Show placeholder text:
  “Select a user to manage permissions”

---

## 🔐 ACCESS RULES (DO NOT CHANGE)

- Only Admin can access this page
- Do NOT modify backend permission logic
- Do NOT auto-save on change — save only on button click

---

## 📂 FILE & COMPONENT STRUCTURE

You may:
- Refactor existing JSX
- Create small helper components if needed

But keep logic inside:
```
@client/src/pages/UserManagement.tsx
```

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS

- ❌ Do NOT render multiple user cards
- ❌ Do NOT change API endpoints
- ❌ Do NOT change permission logic
- ✅ Only UI restructuring + state handling

---

## ✅ EXPECTED RESULT

- Single clean User Management screen
- Dropdown-based user selection
- Admin can manage users one-by-one efficiently
- UI scales cleanly for many users

---

Proceed carefully and confirm once UI refactor is complete.
