# Prompt: Create User Dashboard Page (SCR-006)
# Context: SPECTROPY PMS – User Side Interface
# Goal: Build a dedicated User Dashboard screen for Standard Users
# Tech Stack: React + Tailwind + Shadcn + Framer Motion + Lucide + Dev21 Light Theme

---

## 📍Route
- Path: `/user/dashboard`
- Accessible only after successful login by Standard User role
- Role-based redirection must ensure only standard users access this page

---

## 🧱 Layout Requirements

Split layout with:
- 📌 **Left Sidebar Panel** (Fixed)
  - Title: "Spectropy PMS"
  - Sections:
    - 📊 Dashboard (Active)
    - 📁 My Projects
    - ✅ My Tasks
    - 📈 Reports
    - ⚙️ Settings
  - 🔒 Logout button at bottom
  - Style: Light mode, rounded corners, subtle shadows

- 📌 **Right Panel – Main Dashboard**
  - Welcome message: "Welcome, [User Name]"
  - Cards displaying:
    - 🔢 Total Tasks Assigned
    - ✅ Tasks Completed
    - 🕓 Pending Tasks
  - 📈 Progress Chart (Doughnut/Bar – show % of completed tasks)
  - 🗓️ Recent Activity (show last 5 updates from task history)

---

## 🧠 Data Logic
- Fetch user data via `/api/auth/me` or from token
- Fetch all tasks via `/api/tasks?assigneeId={user.id}`
- Parse:
  - Completed tasks: `status === 'completed'`
  - Total hours from estimateHours/minutes fields
  - Task history timeline: recent updates with timestamps

---

## 🎨 Styling
- All components must follow **Dev21 design system**
- Use Tailwind for layout + Framer Motion for smooth entrance animations
- Ensure **light mode** only (override any default dark theme)
- Responsive design (mobile/tablet friendly)

---

## 📁 Folder Structure
Place files as follows:

- `/src/pages/user/Dashboard.tsx` → Main screen
- `/src/components/user/UserSidebar.tsx`
- `/src/components/user/StatCard.tsx`
- `/src/components/user/ProgressChart.tsx`
- `/src/components/user/RecentActivity.tsx`

---

## ✅ Summary
This is a **minimal, role-specific dashboard** for logged-in users. No admin control. Only show **data relevant to the user** such as their assigned tasks, completion, time tracking, and recent actions.
